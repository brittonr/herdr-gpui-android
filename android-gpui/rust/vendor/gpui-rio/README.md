# gpui-rio (modified copy)

A Rio terminal component for GPUI, vendored from gpui-rio 0.1.0
(<https://github.com/cachix/agentaps>, Apache-2.0) for Herdr GPUI Android's raw
SSH shell mode. Rio (`rio-vt`) owns VT parsing, scrollback and selection; GPUI
draws the grid.

Upstream's package ships no licence file; the Apache-2.0 text is this
repository's [LICENSE](../../../../LICENSE). The changes below are this copy's.

## Changes in this copy

- No local PTY or process. A `Session` parses output from any `Read` and writes
  input to any `Write`, on its own threads; here they are an SSH channel's PTY.
  The reader answers the queries a terminal owes the program (device and cursor
  reports, colour and text-area size) through the same input queue.
- No platform gate, terminfo, working directory or shell spawning, so it builds
  for Android. Without the PTY it needs no `rio-vt` `pty` feature.
- `Terminal::spawn` became `Terminal::attach(session, style, cx)`. Dropping the
  entity stops drawing only; the session's owner ends the stream.
- `set_host_input(true)` is for hosts that deliver keys and text themselves, as
  Android does through one IME bridge: no input handler, no key handling, no
  focus taken, and a cursor drawn without focus.
- `KeyPress` and `key_bytes` encode keys without GPUI types, and the session
  sends them with the program's application-cursor and bracketed-paste modes.
- A cell is the font's own line height (ascent plus descent), not 1.35 × its
  size, as other terminals size cells: box drawing meets row to row, and no
  added leading takes rows from a phone screen.
- Errors are a typed `Error`; `anyhow` and the GPUI tests against a local PTY
  were removed. The tests here drive a real socket pair.

## Use

```rust,ignore
mod terminal {
    gpui_rio::bind_gpui!(gpui);
}

let session = gpui_rio::Session::start(output, input, |columns, rows| { /* resize */ },
    style.theme, 80, 24)?;
let terminal = terminal::Terminal::attach(session.clone(), style, cx);
```

The adapter keeps upstream's per-cell painting, selection, wheel scrollback and
IME composition. Graphics and application mouse reporting are not implemented.
